# How to manage items

**Caesar.Team allows user to create, store and keep up-to-date sensitive information, such as login credentials and notes.**

You have to ways to add secure items \(login credentials and notes\) to Caesar.Team applications:

1. You can [create them manually](https://github.com/caesar-team/docs/blob/master/user-documentation/managing_items.md#create-new-secure-items-manually)
2. You can [import](https://github.com/caesar-team/docs/blob/master/user-documentation/managing_items.md#import-secure-items-into-caesarteam) them via uploading a .csv file

Since you can have many secure items that you work with, it's convenient to separate the most needed items from other items. Check out how to [mark your secure items as favorite](https://github.com/caesar-team/docs/blob/master/user-documentation/managing_items.md#mark-favorite-items)

Since you might want to divide secure items into groups, check out [how to work with lists](https://github.com/caesar-team/docs/blob/master/user-documentation/managing_items.md#working-with-lists)

Since your items might become out-of-date Caesar.Team provides you a tool to update and remove items
