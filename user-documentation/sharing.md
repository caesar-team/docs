# How to share items



**Caesar.Team is a tool to share personal and team sensitive information such as login credentials, notes and docs:**

* You can share sensitive information [within the Caesar.Team application](https://github.com/caesar-team/docs/blob/master/user-documentation/sharing.md#sharing-within-the-caesarteam-application) and [via anonymous links](https://github.com/caesar-team/docs/blob/master/user-documentation/sharing.md#sharing-via-anonymous-links)
* You can choose who you want to share with: users and/or teams
* If somebody else shares sensitive information with you, you will receive Email notification.
