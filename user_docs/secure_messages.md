# Secure Messages

Secure Message is a tool to share temporary secure data:

* Secure messages are encrypted locally so hackers cannot access data
* Encrypted secure messages are stored on Caesar.Team servers until expiration date
* Number of attempts to see secure message can be limited

#### To create a new secured message you need to follow the steps:

To create a secure message you can:

1. Add **description or text note**
2. Add **attachments** \(one attachment cannot be more than 256 kb; all attachments cannot be more than 5 mb\)
3. Set a **number of attempts** - how many time recipients of the secure message have access to it
4. Set **expiration period** - how long recipients of the secure message have access to it
5. Set **your own access password** \(if you do not want to create your personal password, you can use an auto-generated password\)
