# Secure Messages

Secure Message is a tool to share temporary secure data:

* Secure messages are encrypted locally so hackers cannot access data
* Encrypted secure messages are stored on Caesar.Team servers until the expiration date
* Number of attempts to see secure message can be limited

#### This is how you can create secure messages:

1. Open Secure Messages

2. Add needed information and set the main characteristics

1. You can add **description or a text note**
2. You can add **attachments** \(attachments cannot be more than 5 Mb\)
3. You can set a **number of attempts** - how many times the secure message can be retrieved
4. You can set **expiration period** - the time until which the secure message can be retrieved
5. You can set **your own access password** or **you can use an auto-generated password**

3. After you click on the Create Secure Message button and once the secure message is encrypted, you get the link and you can copy it as well as the password.
