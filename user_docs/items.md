### Share secrets

If you want to learn how to share one secret at a time see the steps below. If you want to learn how to share several secrets at a time go to [the section](https://github.com/caesar-team/docs/blob/master/user_docs/items.md#multi-selection-tool).

You can share secrets:

* with individuals
* with teams
* via an anonymous link \(not available for sharing several secrets at a time\) 

#### Share with individuals

You can share secrets with individuals that are domain users and with out-of-domain individuals.

1. Start typing in an email address:

* If the text mate—Äs with a domain user's email - you'll see it and will be able to select a user from the list. 
* If it's an out-of domain individual, you will need to enter the whole email address

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2845%29.png)

2. Once you enter all emails, you'll see a list of recipients \(out of domain recipients will be marked with the "!" sign\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2836%29.png)

3. After the secret is shared, you'll see it

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2859%29.png)

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2849%29.png)

4. After the secret is shared you can withdraw it from a recipient: open Share window, Invited section, and click on the minus icon near a recipient.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2834%29.png)

The secret will be withdrawn and the recipient won't be able to access it any longer.

#### Share with teams



#### Share an anonymous link

Please, note, you can share only one item at a time via an anonymous link.

1. Open a secret and click on one of the available buttons to share secrets

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2846%29.png)

2. Click on the toggle

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2842%29.png)

3 Once an anonymous link is created you can copy it or regenerate it

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2854%29.png)

4. A person who follows the link will see the secret and will be able to use it, i.e. open a website and login with credentials or download an attachment, but will not be able to change the secret

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2857%29.png)

5. If you click on the toggle for the 2nd time, the active link will be deactivated and no one can access the secret with it.

### Favorites

In each vault you have a default list called Favorites that you can use to aggregate the most needed and usable secrets.

Note, that personal Favorites and team Favorites do not mix, meaning if you mark a team secret as favorite, it won't be available in personal Favorites, only in the team Favorites. 

So if you want to mark a secret as favorite you need to follow the steps:

1 Open a secret and click on the "star" icon located on the top.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2855%29.png)

2. Done! Now the secret is marked as favorite and you can see the secret marked as favorite.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2841%29.png)

3. And the secret is available in Favorites.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2839%29.png)

4. You can undo the marking by clicking on the "star" icon again.

### How to delete secrets

If you want to learn how to share one secret at a time see the steps below. If you want to learn how to share several secrets at a time go to [the section](https://github.com/caesar-team/docs/blob/master/user_docs/items.md#multi-selection-tool).

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2858%29.png)

3. In Trash you can restore the secret or delete it permanently:

* if you restore the secret, it'll be restored in the previous list
* if you remove the secret, you'll lose access to the secret permanently and if it's been shared or if it was a team secret then the secret will be deleted for recipients/team members as well

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2837%29.png)

### Multi-selection tool

With the multi-selection tool you can:

* share several secrets with individuals and/teams at a time
* move several secrets to a different list or a vault 
* delete several secrets

Please, note, that you cannot select secrets from different lists. If you select secrets from one list and then move to another list, your selection will be deactivated. 

1 Firstly hover over the first secret you want to select and click on the checkbox

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2851%29.png)
