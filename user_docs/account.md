# How to create a Caesar.Team account

Get started with Caesar.Team by creating your personal account!

Once your company has purchased Caesar.Team, you can [create an account by yourself](https://github.com/caesar-team/docs/blob/master/user_docs/account.md#create-a-caesarteam-account-by-yourself) using your corporate email address.

Please go through all registration steps thoughtfully as you cannot go back to the previous steps!
