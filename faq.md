## **What should I do if I found a security issue?**

The Caesar.Team development team guarantees a high level of service including quickly responding to and fixing reports of bugs or vulnerabilities. The Caesar.Team development team always welcome security research community and other developers to participate and contribute in order to maintain and improve Caesar.Team application.

When reporting potential issues, please be as thorough as possible in providing enough information to recreate their findings and eliminate possible issues as fast as possible.

## Account recovery

Caesar.Team supports multi-factor authentication \(Account password, One Time Passwords, Master Password, Hardware Security Key\) and since a user can lose their authorization credentials, Caesar.Team provides a chance to restore account and secrets in some cases.

### What should I do if I forgot my account password?

If you lost your account password, you need to request your domain admin to reset the password so you can set a new password.

### What should I do if I do not have access to my one time passwords?

Caesar.Team requires one time passwords that you get in two-factor authentication application and theoretically you can lose access to the application \(e.g. the user loses their phone\). To prevent this scenario Caesar.Team allows users to download and save one time password.

### What should I do if I forgot my master password?

Since user’s master password in stored locally, on the user’s device, and Caesar.Team servers does not have access to it, Caesar.Team cannot rest the master password nor create a new master password.

If the user loses their master password they lose their Caesar.Team account and their secrets. However, they can request a domain admin to remove their account so they can create a new account.
